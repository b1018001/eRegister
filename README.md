eRegister
=========

I am attempting to develop an electronic attendance register that I am developing as part of a Web Architectures module I am studying at Sheffield Hallam University as part of my BSc Computing Degree. I am trying to develop this exploring the aspects of MVC modelling and web services and to build a web based portfolio for future references.

To install this project you must have installed grails previously (can be found at http://grails.org/). It is reccomended you run this using a Linux operating system and use the terminal application to clone this project. If you would like to clone or run this on Windows/Mac please view the following pages:

Windows - http://windows.github.com/help.html
Mac - http://mac.github.com/help.html

Here's the git checkout link: git://github.com/b1018001/eRegister.git, you can use the command without the speech marks to clone the repository in a terminal "git clone git://github.com/b1018001/eRegister.git". This is the read only version of my project.

Once you have cloned my repository then execute in a terminal the grails run-app command, this will launch my application and you can then view it at the given URL the terminal responds to.

The database setup is a MySQL database,
